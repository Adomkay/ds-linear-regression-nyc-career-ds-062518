Here we'll begin to explore linear regression in a simple 2 variable case. 
We'll start to think about how to evaluate models and define a loss function to express this evaluation.
From there, we'll optimize our model according to this evaluation function.
All of this serves as a baseline for machine learning we're we'll continue to apply and adapt these concepts.
